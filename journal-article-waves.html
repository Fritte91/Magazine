                    What began as a plan to document a protest soon became a journey beneath the surface of Thailand’s growing cannabis culture — one that revealed stories, communities, and truths far deeper than expected.

                    <h2>How It All Began</h2>
                    <p>
                        It all started around month six or eight of last year. By that time, cannabis had been legal for almost two years. Then, suddenly, rumors began to spread that it might be outlawed again. 
                        As soon as people caught wind of that, they united — north, south, east, and west — to protest against the government's decision to potentially criminalize cannabis once more.

                    <h2>The Unexpected Discovery</h2>
                    <p>
                        I went to that protest planning to interview people and hear their thoughts on cannabis. But once I got there, I ended up learning way more than I expected. 
                        I didn’t just learn about cannabis itself — I discovered the culture surrounding it, the friendships it formed, and how much it had helped people since its legalization.

                        <p>“It wasn’t just a protest — it was a celebration of unity, of healing, and of hope.”</p>

                    <p>
                        That experience opened my eyes. I encountered so many stories, facts, and perspectives that inspired me to create something meaningful — a media platform to share knowledge and highlight the beauty of cannabis culture. 
                        That’s how <strong>Now or Never</strong> was born. I chose the name because it reflected what I felt in that moment: if I don’t do it now, then when?
