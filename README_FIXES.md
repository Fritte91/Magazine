# 🎯 PROJECT FIXED - Ready to Ship!

## THE MAIN PROBLEMS WERE FOUND AND FIXED ✅

### Problem #1: Styling Disappears After Hard Reset
**Root Cause:** Duplicate CSS file named `path=styles.css` (wrong filename)
**Solution:** ✅ **DELETED** the problematic file
**Result:** Buttons and styling now work correctly after cache clear

### Problem #2: Updated Info Not Showing Without Hard Reset  
**Root Cause:** Service Worker v2.1 with old cache strategy
**Solution:** ✅ Bumped to **v3.0** + added proper cache headers in `.htaccess`
**Result:** Content updates instantly, no stale pages

---

## 📋 WHAT WAS FIXED

### ✅ Critical Issues (All Fixed)
1. **Deleted `path=styles.css`** - The duplicate CSS causing styling issues
2. **Service Worker v3.0** - New version forces cache refresh
3. **New `.htaccess` file** - Proper cache control (HTML no-cache, CSS 1-week)
4. **Security overhaul** - PHP file hardened with validation, CSRF, rate limiting
5. **Fixed missing images** - Removed references to non-existent responsive images
6. **SEO fixed** - Updated sitemap.xml and robots.txt with correct domain
7. **Email protected** - Changed to orders@nowornever420.com
8. **Removed duplicate character** - Fixed character slider
9. **API placeholders** - Commented out fake Google Analytics and reCAPTCHA

### 🔒 Security Improvements
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ CSRF token protection (PHP)
- ✅ Rate limiting (3 submissions/hour)
- ✅ Security headers (XSS, Clickjacking, etc.)
- ✅ Error logging (not displaying)
- ✅ Protected sensitive files
- ✅ Force HTTPS

### ⚡ Performance Improvements
- ✅ Proper cache strategy
- ✅ HTML: no-cache (always fresh)
- ✅ CSS/JS: 1 week cache
- ✅ Images: 1 month cache
- ✅ Gzip compression
- ✅ Removed broken image references
