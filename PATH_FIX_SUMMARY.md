# Path Fix Summary - Stories Page

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

Your website was using **two different stories pages**:
- `stories.html` - Old version with outdated content
- `stories-styled.html` - New version with correct content

This caused confusion and caching issues because some links pointed to the wrong file.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Navigation Links**
- ✅ `stories-styled.html` - Fixed empty Stories link (line 34)
- ✅ `stories.html` - Updated Stories link to point to `stories-styled.html`

### 2. **Updated CSS References**
- ✅ `styles.css` - Updated CSS selectors for "View All Stories" button
- ✅ Changed `a.view-all-button[href="stories.html"]` to `a.view-all-button[href="stories-styled.html"]`

### 3. **Updated Sitemap**
- ✅ `sitemap.xml` - Changed URL from `stories.html` to `stories-styled.html`

### 4. **Simplified Netlify Configuration**
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Kept only the redirect from old `stories.html` to `stories-styled.html`
- ✅ Removed unnecessary redirects
